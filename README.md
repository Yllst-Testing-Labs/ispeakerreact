The tool is also available for premium users on the **Oxford Learner's Dictionaries** website. On December 31st, 2021, this old design will be removed in favor of new design. This reposity is created to preserve this version, which works independently without relying on the **Oxford Learner's Dictionaries** website's resources. The new design, however, cannot be used independently because premium account is required.

More information can be found in the [Help](https://yell0wsuit.github.io/ispeaker/help.html) section.

## Known bugs
- Recording and playback is disabled due to unimplemented code.
