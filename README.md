# SpeakerReact

*Formerly Oxford iSpeaker on this repo, a modified version of the official tool of the same name*

**Introducing SpeakerReact**: A modern reimagining of [Oxford iSpeaker](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/about/get-premium/ispeaker)

Rewritten from the ground up, **SpeakerReact** is a self-study interactive tool designed to help learners improve their speaking and listening skills. Based on the original Oxford iSpeaker developed by Oxford University, this new version blends the best of both worlds.

While the official, modern, Angular-based Oxford iSpeaker has introduced significant updates, it also streamlined or removed certain features that users found valuable (like the Exercises section). Therefore, weâ€™ve decided to rebuild the app based on the older jQuery version, while taking inspiration from the newer Angular version to create a richer, more complete learning experience.
