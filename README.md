The tool is also available for premium users on the **Oxford Learner's Dictionaries** website. On December 31st, 2021, this old design was deprecated in favor of new design. This reposity is created to preserve this version, which works independently without relying on the **Oxford Learner's Dictionaries** website's resources. The new design, however, requires online server to function.

More information can be found in the [Help](https://yell0wsuit.github.io/ispeaker/help.html) section.
