                    <p>The Oxford iSpeaker will help you improve your speaking ability in English. It is an interactive tool designed for learners of English who want to speak more accurately and fluently in a variety of situations. It is divided into four sections, each with a focus on a different element of spoken English.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>Sounds</strong>, you can learn and practise the individual vowel and consonant sounds that make up English words. The <strong>Exercises</strong> section provides practice in many aspects of pronunciation, such as sounds and spelling, word stress and syllables. In <strong>Conversations</strong>, you can learn and practise useful phrases that are often used in everyday English. The <strong>Exam Speaking</strong> section contains a range of tasks that typically appear in English speaking exams.</p>
                    <p>When selecting activities in <strong>Sounds</strong>, <strong>Exercises</strong> and <strong>Conversations</strong>, you can choose to focus on British or American English.</p>
                    <p>This is one of <i><a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com">Oxford Learner's Dictionaries</a></i> premium features. It is also available on DVD included in <em>Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary 9th Edition</em>. If you don't have one of those, you can visit this website to use Oxford iSpeaker.</p>

                    <h4 class="fw-semibold mb-4 mt-4"><a name="2_sounds"></a>2 Sounds</h4>
                    <p>Choose <strong>Sounds</strong> to view the menu of different sounds that you can practise. All the consonants, vowels and diphthongs used in English are listed here.</p>
                    <p>If you select the Information icon to the right of each sound, you will see a list of some words that contain the sound.</p>
                    <p>To open, just select <strong>Go</strong> in the <strong>British</strong> or <strong>American</strong> column to the right of the sound you are interested in. For some sounds, <strong>Go</strong> is only displayed in one column because of the differences between British and American English.</p>
                    <p>In the <strong>Watch</strong> section, you can watch a video showing how to pronounce the sound and some words that contain the sound.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Practise</strong> section includes several shorter videos, which show the pronunciation of the sound and the words separately. You can use the Record and Play buttons next to the videos to record and listen to yourself repeating the sound and the words. <strong>Next</strong> to each video, you can read the relevant written forms and phonetic transcriptions.</p>
                    <p>In the <strong>Review</strong> section, you can assess your own pronunciation of the sound.</p>

                    <p>To open, just select <strong>Go</strong> in the <strong>British</strong> or <strong>American</strong> column to the right of the exercise you are interested in.</p>
                    <p>When the page opens, you will see instructions for the exercise you have selected. If you are using the iSpeaker on a smartphone, tap the three horizontal bars in the top left to hide or show the instructions.</p>
                    <p>The exercise appears in the <strong>Practise</strong> section. Your session will end when you select <strong>Quit</strong> or, in the timed activities, when the timer runs out. The <strong>Review</strong> section will open at the end of your session to show your score. You can open the Review section at any time and see your score without ending the activity.</p>
                    <h5 class="fw-semibold mb-4 mt-4"><a name="_Dictation"></a>Dictation</h5>
                    <p>The exercises in <strong>Dictation</strong> include words that are commonly misspelled in English.</p>
                    <p>In each exercise, select the speaker icon to listen to a word or sentence, and type the word, missing word or sentence in the space provided.</p>
                    <p>In <strong>Words</strong>, listen and type the single word you hear. In <strong>Missing words</strong>, look at the gapped sentence, listen to the complete sentence and type the missing word you hear.

                    <p>Press the <strong>Submit</strong> button to find out whether your answer is correct or incorrect. You must spell everything correctly. In <strong>Sentences</strong>, you do not need to use a capital letter at the start of each sentence or a full stop at the end. If your answer is incorrect, the correct answer will be displayed below. Use the <strong>Next</strong> button to move to the next question or to skip a question. If you choose to skip a question, it will count as an incorrect answer. When you want to stop, select <strong>Quit</strong> to see your score for the session.</p>
                    <h5 class="fw-semibold mb-4 mt-4"><a name="_Match"></a>Match-up</h5>

                    <p>In each exercise, look at the group of six words or phonetic transcriptions on the right. Select each of the speaker icons on the left to listen to words or sentences. Rearrange the words or phonetic transcriptions so that they are next to the corresponding speaker icons.</p>

In <strong><strong>Reading phonetics</strong></strong>, match the phonetic transcriptions you see to the words you hear. In <strong>Comprehension</strong>, match the words you see to the sentences you hear - each sentence contains one of the words. <strong>Random</strong> includes a selection of questions from the other three exercises.</p>
                    <p>Once you have finished rearranging a group of words or phonetic transcriptions, press the <strong>Submit</strong> button to find out which of your answers are correct and which are incorrect. Use the <strong>Next</strong> button to move to the next question or to skip a question. If you choose to skip a question, the six items in that question will count as incorrect answers. When you want to stop, select <strong>Quit</strong> to see your score for the session.</p>
                    <h5 class="fw-semibold mb-4 mt-4"><a name="_Reordering"></a>Reordering</h5>

The timer will begin when you start rearranging the first set of letters or words, and your score will be displayed when the timer runs out.

                    <h5 class="fw-semibold mb-4 mt-4"><a name="_OddOut"></a>Odd One Out</h5>
                    <p>The exercises in <strong>Odd One Out</strong> include words that rhyme, or that have similar word stress patterns or numbers of syllables.</p>

                    <p>In <strong><strong>Reading phonetics</strong></strong>, look at the phonetic transcription and the written form of the word. Select <strong>Yes</strong> if they match or <strong>No</strong> if not. In <strong>Homophones</strong>, look at the two words and select <strong>Yes</strong> if the pronunciation is the same or <strong>No</strong> if it is different. <strong>Random</strong> includes a selection of questions from the other two exercises.</p>
                    <p>You have two minutes to answer as many questions as possible. The timer will begin when you open the exercise, and your score will be displayed when the timer runs out.

You can find the language that you should use to fill the gaps in the dialogue in the <strong>Useful Language</strong> lists. You can then carry out the same activity, playing the part of the other speaker. You can also write your own conversation in the box at the bottom of the Practise section, and then record and listen to yourself.</p>
                    <p>In the <strong>Review</strong> section, you can assess your own performance.</p>

                    <p>If you launch Oxford iSpeaker for the first time, you will see a notification toast at the bottom of the screen. If you decide to cache every file for offline use, select "Yes". Due to browser's limitation on cache storage, the audio files will only be cached on-demand, meaning that they will only be cached if you go to sections that have sound audio. The app will requires approximately 320MB if you cache all of the files. Videos are not included, so you still need Internet connection to watch them.</p>
                    <p>If you select "No", Oxford iSpeaker will only cache necessary files to work. Audio files are not included which saves storage space.</p>
                    <p>Select "Don't show again" to make the notification toast go away. If you ever want to reverse this, you will need to clear the web data or use the browser's Developer Tools.</p>
